# eMercado eCommerce frontend

eMercado is a front-end simulation of an eCommerce platform designed to showcase products across various categories. It interacts with an API to fetch product data and allows users to filter and sort items based on their preferences. The project also features a product detail page, a user login system, and a shopping cart simulation.

## Key Features

- **Product Listing**: Displays products from multiple categories such as Autos, Juguetes (Toys), and Muebles (Furniture).
- **Filtering & Sorting**: Allows users to filter products by price range and sort them by name or number of products in each category.
- **Product Detail Pages**: Displays detailed information for each product, including images, descriptions, and related products.
- **User Authentication**: Simulated login system where users can create and store profiles.
- **Carousel & Responsive Design**: A carousel for featured items and responsive layout for different screen sizes.
- **Image Zoom**: Desktop and mobile zoom functionality for product images.
- **Comment System**: Users can rate products and leave comments.
